# Project Monitoring & Controlling
Monitoring and controlling a project entail keeping track of its progress, identifying any problems, and making the appropriate adjustments.

### Performance Analysis
The practise of analysing a scenario's performance in relation to the goal that was intended to be attained is called performance analysis. Based on ROI, earnings, and other factors, performance analysis is possible in finance. Performance analysis in HR can be used to evaluate an employee's contribution to a project or task that was given to them.

### Determine Variance Deviation Threshold
Variance is a quantifiable departure from a recognised baseline or standard. The cost, time, and scope are identified in project management to create the baseline for deviation. The work-breakdown structure (WBS), a hierarchical representation of all tasks to be completed, is created by the project management team. The work-breakdown structure is then used to determine the cost and schedule (WBS). When estimating the cost of each objective or task, an average daily, hourly, monthly, or annual rate may be used. For each objective or undertaking, the fixed expenses are identified. The project management team also determines how many days or hours are needed to complete a job or goal. Next, they develop a time-phased budget to calculate the cost of performance.
