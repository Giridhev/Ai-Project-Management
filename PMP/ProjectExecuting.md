# Project Executing
Execution is the phase of a project in which every team's plans are implemented. The implementation plan for the project is as follows:

### System Interface Design
The facial recognition system is based on the design of the system interface. This entails developing the entire system to encompass the essential components, such as function, user profile, homepage, etc. This must also consider the user experience when the user has an excellent sense of usage. Before creating a comprehensive interface system, this phase must take a wide variety of variables into account.

### API Design & Development
API design is the set of architectural and planning considerations made during API development. The architecture of an API impacts both the ability of developers to utilise it and their usage patterns. Therefore, this must take into account the user's API to prevent the user from having a poor experience when utilising the API. When the API design is finished, the API can be developed.

### Data Acquisation
Essential to data collection and understanding is gathering the relevant data. As our project is a face mask recognition system, we must collect photographs of human faces with face mask in order to proceed to the next phase.

### Data Preparation
Data preparation ensures that all necessary data has been collected and is well-prepared for AI model training. The acquired data will be tagged to indicate the location of human faces. The data can then be utilised in the subsequent phase.

### Image Processing
Face mask recognition necessitates the application of image processing techniques to the gathered data. This step is necessary for the user to input photographs or capture their face in real-time.

### Feature Extraction
Extraction of features is a vital aspect of dimensionality reduction, which can facilitate image processing by making the image easier to handle. Its goal is to facilitate the processing of the desired characteristics of the data by splitting the data and extracting only its key points. In addition, it assists with data management.

### Define AI Model
Define the required AI model for this project. In this step, the project's function and the AI Model required to move to the subsequent phase are analysed.

### AI Model Training
The necessary AI model is subdivided, and then formal AI model training occurs. After Training, combine per project specifications.

### Documentation Development
At this step, when all preceding phases have been completed, the development documentation will be developed, which will include all the written source code and act as the system document.

### Project & Chart Update
This stage is one of continual rejuvenation from start to finish. This is for the ease of being able to see each step of the project's development.
