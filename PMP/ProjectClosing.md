# Closing Process
The word "closing process" refers to a series of processes that have been carried out in order to formally end and close all tasks, activities, and component pieces of a certain project or phase of a project. The transmission, acceptance, and approval of the final deliverables to the assigning party or, in the event the activity did not really take place, starting and concluding the cancellation process will then often constitute the final steps of the closing process.

### Project Deliverables
All outputs, tangible or intangible, that are submitted as part of a project's scope are referred to as deliverables. While the phrase may immediately conjure images of the final products that are delivered at the conclusion of a project, it actually refers to any project-related product delivered over the course of the project. To appropriately define expectations and assign resources, project deliverables must be agreed upon early in the planning phase and documented inside a governing project charter. This way, they may be referred to at any time over the course of the project.

### Operations and Support Responsibilities
Conduct performance evaluations and provide feedback to employees.

### Archive Documentation
When the project is completed, it is time for the project management office (PMO) to deal with the remaining documentation. This guide for PMO on how to archive a completed project will assist us in streamlining the process so that a project can be completed efficiently. Archiving project documents is likely the final task of a project and will be completed by either the last worker on the project or someone from the PMO team. Depending on the work, archiving is done as hard copy documents, digital archiving, or a combination of the two.

### Formalize Closure
After all of the above is completed, the project is done and ready.
