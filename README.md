## Project Introduction
There are no efficient face mask detection applications in the midst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which is now in high demand for transportation means, densely populated areas, residential districts, large-scale manufacturers, and other enterprises to ensure safety. The lack of large datasets of 'with mask' images has made this task time-consuming and difficult. 

Our face mask detector makes no use of morphed masked images, and the model is accurate. It is computationally efficient due to the use of MobileNetV2 architecture, making it easier to deploy the model to embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, etc.). As a result of the Covid-19 outbreak, this system can be used in real-time applications that require face-mask detection for safety purposes. This project can be integrated with embedded systems and used to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places.

PMP (Project Management Plan) has five phases.
- Project initiating
- Project Planning
- Project Executing
- Project Monitoring and Controlling
- Project Closing
